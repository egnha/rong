## 0.1.0.9000

### Operator for input validation

* A new operator `%secure%` provides an alternative way to write checks next to
  function headers ([#21](https://github.com/egnha/valaddin/issues/21),
  suggested by @MilkWasABadChoice). For example, writing
  `list(~is.numeric, ~{. > 0}) %secure% function(a, b) a + b` is equivalent to
  writing `firmly(~is.numeric, ~{. > 0}, .f = function(a, b) a + b)`. Using the
  `%secure%` operator is the recommended way to apply input validation in
  scripts and packages.
  
### New functions

* The localized check makers `vld_any()` and `vld_all()` correspond to the base
  predicates `any()` and `all()`.

* To match naive expectations, a localized check maker `vld_closure()` is
  introduced to validate _closures_, i.e., non-primitive functions, while 
  `vld_function()` has been redefined to validate functions in general, i.e., it
  corresponds to the base R predicate `is.function` 
  ([#18](https://github.com/egnha/valaddin/issues/18)).
  
### Minor improvements and bug fixes

* Reduced use of assignment, subsetting and warning suppression speeds up 
  `firmly` to within an order of magnitude of the speed of input validation
  using `stopifnot`.

* The environment of check formulae generated by the `vld_*()` check makers is
  the package namespace environment. (Previously, such check formulae got their
  own environment, though there was no need for such separation.)
  
* Printing of functions (i.e., those underlying firmly applied functions and 
  predicate functions of check-formula makers) is normalized to eliminate
  spurious indentation ([#23](https://github.com/egnha/valaddin/issues/23)).

* Minor edits to vignette.

## 0.1.0

* First stable release:
    + Main functional operators: `firmly`, `loosely`
    + Component extractors: `firm_checks`, `firm_core`, `firm_args`
    + Check-scope converters (checker factories): `localize`, `globalize`
    + Localized base-R- and purrr-predicate checkers: `vld_*`
    
* `vld_numeric`, `vld_scalar_numeric` are based on `base::is.numeric`, since the
  corresponding predicates in purrr will be deprecated starting from version 
  0.2.2.9000 ([#12](https://github.com/egnha/valaddin/issues/12)).

* Fulfills aim of purrr proposal 
  [#275](https://github.com/hadley/purrr/issues/275) (closed).
